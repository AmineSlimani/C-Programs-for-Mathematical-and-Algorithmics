## Description of Some Key Programs

### Display and Fill an Array Using Pointers
This program demonstrates how to fill and display an array using pointers in C.

### Base 2 (0,1)
A simple program to convert numbers into binary representation (base 2).

### Sort in Descending Order
This program sorts a list of numbers in descending order using an efficient sorting algorithm.

### Determinant of a 2x2 Matrix
This program computes the determinant of a 2x2 matrix by applying the determinant formula.

### Simple Array 
A beginner-level exercise that focuses on simple array operations, including initializing and manipulating arrays.

### Factorial.c
This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursive or iterative methods.

### Function F(x) = sin(x) + log(x)
This program evaluates the mathematical function F(x) = sin(x) + log(x) for a given input value.

### Max and Min of Four Integers
This program finds the maximum and minimum values among four integers provided by the user.

### GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

### Prime Number
A basic program to check whether a given number is prime.

## How to Run

To compile and run any of the `.c` files, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command line.
2. Navigate to the folder where the file is stored.
3. Use a C compiler such as `gcc` to compile the file. For example:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ```
4. Run the compiled file:
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```
